# shooter_ad

A squad shooter in the mobile-ad style, being reshaped into **DPS golf**: every
few seconds you are shown three bonuses and must judge, before they reach you,
which most increases your damage output.

**Read `notes.md` before changing gameplay.** It holds the design intent — what
the game is for, which bonuses exist and why, and the roadmap. This file
describes how the code works. When they disagree, `notes.md` is the intent and
this file is stale.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci          # first time in a fresh session
npm run dev     # vite dev server, hot reload
npm run build   # typecheck + production build to dist/
npm run verify  # REQUIRED before claiming a change works
npm run balance # time series of power, DPS, par DPS, standing, enemy knobs
npm run hud     # screenshots the HUD in early / mid / late upgrade states
```

`npm run verify` does not build — run `npm run build` first. It serves `dist/`,
plays the game headlessly with simulated input, and fails on any console error,
a blank frame, zero kills, a stalled wave counter, or a ring over cap. The
screenshot lands in `.verify/screenshot.png` — **look at it**, don't just trust
the exit code.

`npm run hud` forces the squad into fixed progress states and photographs each
one into `.verify/`. `verify` plays from scratch, so it only ever photographs an
empty build - no multipliers, no guns, no pierce - and the readout beneath the
red line exists for the state `verify` never reaches. Judge HUD legibility off
these, not off the verify frame.

`npm run balance` plays several fixed seeds and prints the series. Use it before
and after any balance change. `PROBE_SECONDS=240 PROBE_SEEDS=1,2,3
PROBE_VERBOSE=1` for a longer, fuller run.

**A passing typecheck is not verification.** Never report a gameplay change as
working without `verify` output.

## Measurement is the hard part here

Three separate balance conclusions in this project turned out to be wrong for
measurement reasons rather than game reasons. Before trusting any number:

- **Seed it.** An unseeded run varies ~2× on gate luck alone — more than most
  changes being evaluated. `?seed=123` fixes the sequence. The probe always
  seeds; the squad's firing jitter is seeded too, so runs are reproducible.
- **Compare like with like.** `standing` is a ratio of *DPS*, not power. Par
  optimises for DPS and will sit on a small potent squad, so comparing its power
  against a player who stacked army-size gates is meaningless and once produced
  standings above 20.
- **One run proves nothing.** Read medians across seeds.

The probe's bot is crude: it steers by a preference over bonus *axes* and has no
threat avoidance or positioning. Under the current taxonomy that is barely a
player at all — the decision the game asks is between two magnitudes of the same
axis, which a preference over axes cannot express. Treat its numbers as a floor
on difficulty, not a verdict on how the game feels, and treat anything that
depends on picking *well* as unmeasured until the bot is rebuilt.

## Architecture

```
src/
  config.ts            every tunable number — balance lives here, not in logic
  data/                content tables: tiers, enemies, gates
  systems/             simulation; no Phaser display objects except SpritePool
  scenes/              Boot (textures), Game (sim + render), UI (HUD)
```

`systems/` holds plain classes with no display objects; `GameScene.render()`
syncs pooled sprites to that state once per frame. Gameplay is therefore
readable and testable without touching Phaser.

**Keep files small and split early.** Agents add features well and restructure
large files badly. Past ~250 lines, split before adding.

**Content lives in tables, not `if` chains.** Adding an enemy or a bonus should
be an append to `data/`. Editing a `switch` to add content means the design is
wrong.

### `Progression.ts` is the single definition of squad strength

The squad fires from it and the difficulty model budgets against it. Two copies
would drift and the difficulty curve would silently stop matching the game. Any
new stat, bonus form, or damage term goes here — including the pierce valuation,
so that par and the player price it identically. If they diverge, the death
screen's "optimal pick" scoring becomes a lie.

### Difficulty is closed-loop

Enemy strength is **not** keyed to wave number. `systems/Difficulty.ts` tracks a
shadow "par" player who takes the best gate offered every time — scored by
resulting DPS, not raw power — and collects every bonus. Enemy HP is derived:

```
budget/sec = squadDps(par) * targetFraction * pressure
hpMult     = budget/sec / (spawnRate * avgPoolHp)
```

Spawn rate keeps a hand-authored curve, so pacing stays authored while
difficulty stays automatic.

Two properties are easy to break:

- **The budget spends two knobs, not one.** Toughness first, wave thickness
  second. Spending only toughness let a weakened player drown in trivial
  enemies whose count still cost power on every breach.
- **Par is eased over `smoothingSeconds`.** Multiplier gates double par at an
  instant, which otherwise halves the player's standing with no warning.

`DIFFICULTY.maxOverPlayer` is a mercy clamp: par grows on perfect play whether
or not the player kept up, so without any clamp one missed multiplier gate
ratchets difficulty out of reach and the run spirals. **It is slated to be
softened substantially** — see `notes.md`; losing control should be legible, not
prevented. Removing it entirely reproduces a reliable death spiral around wave
7, so re-probe after touching it.

**Know which of the two regimes you are measuring in.** The clamp takes over
exactly below `standing = targetFraction / maxOverPlayer` — 0.52 at the current
constants. Above that the curve is par-driven and skill-responsive; below it,
enemy pressure is simply 1.35× whatever the player is doing, and neither
`targetFraction` nor par influences the run at all. The probe's bot lives almost
entirely below 0.52, so any conclusion about the par-driven regime drawn from
its numbers is a conclusion about a regime it never entered. Softening the clamp
moves this threshold up and hands more of the run back to par.

Raise `targetFraction` toward 1 to make the game meaner; lower it to make wins
feel bigger.

## Known-broken, measured, not yet fixed

These came out of `npm run balance` and are load-bearing for the roadmap. Do not
tune balance around them — fix them first.

- **Five of eight enemy types move identically**, because their `behaviour`
  cases fall through to `default` in `Enemies.applyBehaviour`. `charger` has a
  working case no enemy uses. `shielder`'s "frontal armour" is
  direction-independent, so the name describes nothing.
- **The probe bot cannot see the decision the game is about.** It ranks gates by
  axis, and the redesign's interesting choice is between two magnitudes of the
  *same* axis. Every balance number is soft until it is rebuilt on real DPS
  deltas with a `PROBE_SKILL` knob.

Fixed, and worth knowing why they mattered: the rank ladder used to saturate at
608 power, which turned every army bonus above it into a measured no-op and left
par unable to tell its options apart — it kept whatever it scored first on a
strict `>`, including a trap, and two seeds showed it halving its own army. The
ladder now runs six ranks past red, `SQUAD.maxPower` is derived from the top row
so that dead region cannot return, and par breaks ties toward the option leaving
the most power.

## Determinism is a product requirement

Seeds are meant to be shareable — replay your run, or hand a friend the same
one. That makes reproducibility a feature, not a testing convenience:

- Every consumer of randomness goes through the seeded generator from
  `systems/Rng.ts`. A stray `Math.random()` anywhere breaks it; the squad's
  firing jitter already caught this once.
- Nothing gameplay-affecting may read wall-clock or raw frame timing. The
  simulation advances on a clamped step.
- **Balance changes change outcomes.** A seed is only comparable within a
  version, so a version tag travels with it.

## The ring cap

The formation never exceeds **three hex rings (1 + 6 + 12 = 19 units)**, set by
`SQUAD.ringCap`. This is the fix for the genre's classic failure, where a large
army becomes an unmanageable blob and positioning stops mattering.

`Squad.power` drives both size and strength: visible units = `min(power,
ringCap)`, and power beyond the cap is dealt evenly across those units as
power-per-unit, which maps to a shirt colour in `data/tiers.ts` (grey → green →
blue → purple → orange → red, then six prestige ranks: bronze → silver → gold →
platinum → diamond → prismatic). The remainder goes to innermost units first, so
the leader ranks up before the outer ring — which is why a mid-run squad shows
two colours at once.

Thresholds double per rank, from 1 to 2048 power-per-unit; `SQUAD.maxPower` is
derived as that top threshold × `ringCap`, so there is no power range the ranks
do not cover. **Damage and fire rate interpolate geometrically between rows
rather than stepping at them** — bonus magnitudes are drawn from `[1.05, 1.50]`
and thresholds double, so a stepped ladder would make a `×1.2 ARMY` worth
nothing most of the time. The tier row is the visible rank; the stats are
continuous in power.

## Collision is bespoke, not Arcade or Matter

Every interaction is circle-vs-circle with no gravity, stacking, or resting
contact — the case where a physics library costs more than it gives. Two guards
matter and are in place:

- `delta` is clamped to 1/30s in `GameScene.update`, so fast bullets cannot
  tunnel through enemies on a slow frame.
- Bullet-vs-enemy goes through the uniform `Grid` broad-phase, never a nested
  loop.

## Art

Entirely procedural, generated in `BootScene` with `Graphics#generateTexture`.
Everything is drawn white and tinted at runtime, so one texture serves every
colour. No asset files, nothing to load at runtime — which is what keeps the
build a static folder.

`TextureManager.generate` and the Create palettes were **removed in Phaser v4**;
see `.claude/skills/phaser4-migration/`.

## Extending content

- **Enemy**: append to `ENEMIES` in `data/enemies.ts`. Only genuinely new
  movement needs a case in `Enemies.applyBehaviour`. Note five of the eight
  current types move identically because their cases fall through to `default`,
  and `charger` is dead code — fixing that is on the roadmap.
- **Bonus**: append to `CANDIDATES` in `data/gates.ts` plus one case in the
  progression model. Magnitudes are never hardcoded — every bonus draws from the
  root table in `data/roots.ts` and presents the draw according to its form.
  Colour names the axis and both forms of an axis share it, so the player cannot
  read the raw-versus-multiplicative choice off the tint instead of doing the
  conversion.
  Every bonus must change damage output and must not be trivially rankable by
  label alone — see the taxonomy in `notes.md`. Pierce is valued with a fixed
  ratio rather than live enemy density, deliberately: density swings across a
  wave, so a density-derived number scores a pick against a truth that lasted
  one second. Par and the player must price every bonus with the same function
  or the death screen's "optimal pick" marker lies to the player about their
  own mistake.
- **Army growth**: gates, rescue cages, kill streaks (`STREAK`), wave-clear
  bonuses (`WAVE.clearBonus`). Add another by calling `squad.addPower()`.
